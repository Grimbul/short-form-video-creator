AITA for refusing to babysit my grandchild due to her not being my biological grandkid
I was told to come here. My son was married to Emma. They got married and had a kid, apparently he had doubts about if he was the father and got a dna test. He was not but has been in the kids life for 4 years and his name is on the birth certificate so he is legally responsible, and he still loves the kid.
Now my issue is that before they divorced I was never allowed near the grandkid. I ask to babysit but they both cited that my home was unsafe and they do not trust me with a baby, even if I raised four kids. They wouldn’t even bring the kid to family events like Christmas. They did this with all of his siblings. I know I am more country then them but it hurt a lot. My other kids relationship with him is strained because they believe he is looking down on them after he got a city job.
Now after the divorce he has the kid almost 50 percent of the time, and he keeps asking me to babysit. I told him straight up that I will not babysit the kid since she not my grandkid and you made it clear I wasn’t good enough to babysit when you thought she was your kid. Huge argument and he thinks I am awful. I just think he wants someone to parent due to not being able to rely on his ex wife anymore.
—— the reason he claimed my house was unsafe was the horses, this is in two other comments. Nothing about my house has changed. Everything is locked if it is dangerous. I’ve watched my other grandkid and their has been zero issues.
